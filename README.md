# Airline Flight Delays 
This project analyses 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights that took place in 2015 and were compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. Each flight record includes information such as the airline name, flight number, origin/destination airport, flight distance, as well as scheduled and actual departure and arrival times.

## Recommended Analysis
* Flight Volume Variation: Analyze how the overall flight volume varies by month and day of week. Results show that the highest number of flights occur in July with 521,000 flights, with a low in February with 429,000 flights. On average, there are 485,000 flights per month. On the day level, Wednesdays have the most flights with 873,000 flights, while Fridays have the least with 701,000 flights.

* Departure Delays: Determine the percentage of flights that experienced a departure delay in 2015 and calculate the average delay time in minutes. Results show that 2 million flights experienced a delay out of 6 million flights, with an average delay time of 9.37 minutes.

* Delayed Flights Throughout the Year: Analyze how the percentage of delayed flights varies throughout the year and for flights leaving from Boston (BOS) specifically.

* Flight Cancellations: Determine the number of flights that were cancelled in 2015 and calculate the percentage of cancellations that were due to weather and the percentage that were due to the airline/carrier. Results show that 90,000 flights were cancelled, with 54.35% of cancellations being due to weather and 28.11% being due to the airline/carrier.

* Airline Reliability: Analyze which airlines seem to be the most and least reliable in terms of on-time departure. Results show that the least reliable airline is South Airlines Co. with 16,000 cancelled flights and 567,000 delayed flights, while the most reliable airline is Virgin America with less than 1,000 cancelled flights and about 10,000 delayed flights.
